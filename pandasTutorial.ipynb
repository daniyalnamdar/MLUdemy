    "Introducing Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a Python library that makes handling tabular data easier. Since we’re doing data science - this is something we’ll use from time to time!\n",
    "It’s one of three libraries you’ll encounter repeatedly in the field of data science:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas\n",
    "Introduces “Data Frames” and “Series” that allow you to slice and dice rows and columns of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy\n",
    "Usually you’ll encounter “NumPy arrays”, which are multi-dimensional array objects. It is easy to create a Pandas DataFrame from a NumPy array, and Pandas DataFrames can be cast as NumPy arrays. NumPy arrays are mainly important because of…\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit_Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning library we’ll use throughout this course is scikit_learn, or sklearn, and it generally takes NumPy arrays as its input.\n",
    "So, a typical thing to do is to load, clean, and manipulate your input data using Pandas. Then convert your Pandas DataFrame into a NumPy array as it’s being passed into some Scikit_Learn function. That conversion can often happen automatically.\n",
